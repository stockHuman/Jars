# Jars

For the longest time I used three markdown files that I kept in an always-open text editor to organize my life. I built _Jars_, so named after the C. Crawford ritual, as an answer to those markdown files.

Jars runs off of a CRUD capable server that spits out JSON. Through this, I can save tasks and view them wherever, and be aware of my day.
